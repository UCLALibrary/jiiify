Hello, world! This is the first post on the Jiiify Image Server project. Jiiify is a version 2, level 0 IIIF image server that pre-generates the tiles needed to use IIIF compliant viewers like Mirador 
and OpenSeadragon. It was started as an experiment to learn reactive programming and to build on my experiences with freelib-djatoka, and it's has been puttering along since. Recently, with an 
image-oriented project at work, I've gotten the chance to spend some more time on it. Now, I've pulled out the parts that were using proprietary code and am going to make the repository public on GitHub. 
It's still not ready for primetime use (it's still in an experimental state, with sweeping changes being made), but without the proprietary parts there is no reason to keep it in a private repo any longer.

If you want to kick the tires, I'd welcome comments and suggestions.
